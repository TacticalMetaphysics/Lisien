Introduction
============

Life sims all seem to have two problems in common:

Too much world state
--------------------

The number of variables the game is tracking -- just for game logic,
not graphics or physics or anything -- is very large. Like how The
Sims tracks sims' opinions of one another, their likes and dislikes
and so forth, even for the ones you never talk to and have shown no
interest in. If you streamline a life sim to where it doesn't have
extraneous detail, you lose a huge part of what makes it
lifelike. This causes trouble for developers when even *they* don't
understand why sims hate each other

To address all those problems, LiSE provides a state container.
Everything that ever happens in a game gets recorded, so that you can
pick through the whole history and find out exactly when the butterfly
flapped its wings to cause the cyclone. All of that history gets saved
in a database, which is used in place of traditional save files.
This means that if your testers discover something strange and want
you to know about it, they can send you their database, and you'll
know everything they did and everything that happened in their game.

Too many rules
--------------

Fans of life sims tend to appreciate complexity. Developers are best
served by reducing complexity as much as possible. So LiSE makes it
easy to compartmentalize complexity and choose what of it you want to
deal with and when.

It is a rules engine, an old concept from business software that lets
you determine what conditions cause what effects. Here, conditions are
Triggers and effects are Actions, and they're both lists of Python
functions. Actions make some change to the state of the world, while
Triggers look at the world once-per-turn and return a Boolean to show
whether their Actions should happen.

Concepts
--------

LiSE is a tool for constructing turn-based simulations following rules
in a directed graph-based world model. It has special affordances for
the kinds of things you might need to simulate in the life simulation
genre.

Rules are things the game should do in certain conditions. In LiSE,
the "things to do" are called Actions, and are functions that can run
arbitrary Python code. The conditions are divided into Triggers and
Prereqs, of which only Triggers are truly necessary: they are also
functions, but one of a rule's Triggers must return True for the
Action to proceed.

A directed graph is made of nodes and edges. The nodes are points
without fixed locations--when drawing a graph, you may arrange the
nodes however you like, as long as the edges connect them the same
way. Edges in a directed graph connect one node to another node, but
not vice-versa, so you can have nodes A and B where A is connected to
B, but B is not connected to A. But you can have edges going in both
directions between A and B. They're usually drawn as arrows.

In LiSE, edges are called Portals, and nodes may be Places or
Things. You can use these to represent whatever you want, but they
have special properties to make it easier to model physical space: in
particular, each Thing is located in exactly one node at a time
(usually a Place), and may be travelling through one of the Portals
leading out from there. Regardless, you can keep any data you like in
a Thing, Place, or Portal by treating it like a dictionary.

LiSE's directed graphs are called Characters. Every time something
about a Character changes, LiSE remembers when it happened -- that is,
which turn of the simulation. This allows the developer to look up the
state of the world at some point in the past. This time travel is
nearly real-time in most cases, to make it convenient to flip
back and forth between a correct world state and an incorrect one
and use your intuition to spot exactly what went wrong.

See :doc:`LiSE/design` for details.

Usage
-----
The only LiSE class that you should ever instantiate yourself is
:class:`LiSE.engine.Engine`. All simulation objects should be
created and accessed through it. By default, it keeps the simulation
code and world state in the working directory, but you can pass in another
directory if you prefer. Either use it with a context manager
(``with Engine() as eng:``) or call its ``.close()`` method when you're done.

World Modelling
+++++++++++++++

Start by calling the engine's ``new_character`` method with a string
``name`` to get a character object.
Draw a graph by calling the method ``new_place`` with many
different ``name`` s, then linking them together with the
method ``new_portal(origin, destination)``.

To store data pertaining
to some specific place, retrieve the place from the ``place``
mapping of the character: if the character is ``world`` and the place
name is ``'home'``, you might do it like
``home = world.place['home']``. Portals are retrieved from the ``portal``
mapping, where you'll need the origin and the destination: if there's
a portal from ``'home'`` to ``'narnia'``, you can get it like
``wardrobe = world.portal['home']['narnia']``, but if you haven't also
made another portal going the other way,
``world.portal['narnia']['home']`` will raise ``KeyError``.

Things, usually being located in places (but possibly in other things),
are most conveniently created by the ``new_thing`` method of Place objects:
``alice = home.new_thing('alice')`` gets you a new Thing object
located in ``home``. Things can be retrieved like ``alice = world.thing['alice']``.
Ultimately, things and places are both just nodes, and both can be
retrieved in a character's ``node`` mapping, but only things have
methods like ``travel_to``, which finds a path to a destination
and schedules movement along it.

You can store data in things, places, and portals by treating them
like dictionaries.  If you want to store data in a character, use its
``stat`` property as a dictionary instead. Data stored in these
objects, and in the ``universal`` property of the engine, can vary
over time, and be rewound by setting ``turn`` to some time before.
The engine's ``eternal`` property is not time-sensitive,
and is mainly for storing settings, not simulation data.

Rule Creation
+++++++++++++

To create a rule, first decide what objects the rule should apply
to. You can put a rule on a character, thing, place, or portal; and
you can put a rule on a character's ``thing``, ``place``, and
``portal`` mappings, meaning the rule will be applied to *every* such
entity within the character, even if it didn't exist when the rule was
declared.

All these items have a property ``rule`` that can be used as a
decorator. Use this to decorate a function that performs the rule's
action by making some change to the world state. The function should take
only one argument, the item itself.

At first, the rule object will not have any triggers, meaning the action
will never happen. If you want it to run on *every* tick, pass the decorator
``always=True`` and think no more of it. But if you want to be
more selective, use the rule's ``trigger`` decorator on another
function with the same signature, and have it return ``True`` if the
world is in such a state that the rule ought to run. Triggers must never
mutate the world or use any randomness.

If you like, you can also add prerequisites. These are like triggers,
but use the ``prereq`` decorator, and should return ``True`` *unless*
the action should *not* happen; if a single prerequisite returns
``False``, the action is cancelled. Prereqs may involve random elements.
Use the ``engine`` property of any LiSE entity to get the engine,
then use methods such as ``percent_chance`` and ``dice_check``.

Time Control
++++++++++++

The current time is always accessible from the engine's ``branch`` and
``turn`` properties. In the common case where time is advancing
forward one tick at a time, it should be done with the engine's
``next_turn`` method, which polls all the game rules before going to
the next turn; but you can also change the time whenever you want, as
long as ``branch`` is a string and ``turn`` is an integer. The rules
will never be followed in response to your changing the time "by
hand".

It is possible to change the time as part of the
action of a rule. This is how you would make something happen after a
delay. Say you want a rule that puts the character ``alice`` to sleep,
then wakes her up after eight turns (presumably hour-long).::

	alice = engine.character['alice']

	@alice.rule
	def sleep(character):
		character.stat['awake'] = False
		start_turn = character.engine.turn
		with character.engine.plan() as plan_num:
			character.engine.turn += 8
			character.stat['awake'] = True
		character.stat['wake_plan'] = plan_num

At the end of a ``plan():`` block, the game-time will be reset to its
position at the start of that block. You can use the plan's ID number,
``plan_num`` in the above, to cancel it yourself -- some other rule
could call ``engine.delete_plan(engine.character['alice'].stat['wake_plan'])``.

Input Prompts
+++++++++++++

LiSE itself doesn't know what a player is or how to accept input from them,
but does use some conventions for communicating with a user interface
such as ELiDE.

To ask the player to make a decision, first define a method for them to
call, then return a menu description like this one.::

	@engine.method
	def wake_alice(self):
		self.character['alice'].stat['awake'] = True

	alice = engine.character['alice']

	@alice.rule
	def wakeup(character):
		return "Wake up?", [("Yes", character.engine.wake_alice), ("No", None)]

Only methods defined with the ``@engine.method`` function store may be used in a menu.
