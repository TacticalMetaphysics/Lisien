.. automodule:: LiSE.engine

	.. autoclass:: LiSE.engine.Engine

		.. autoproperty:: LiSE.Engine.branch

		.. automethod:: is_ancestor_of

		.. autoproperty:: LiSE.Engine.turn

		.. py:property:: Engine.time

			Acts like a tuple of (branch, turn) for the most part.

			This wraps a :class:`blinker.Signal`. To set a function to be called whenever the
			branch or turn changes, pass it to the ``Engine.time.connect`` method.

		.. py:property:: Engine.rule

			A mapping of all rules that have been made.

		.. py:property:: Engine.rulebook

			A mapping of lists of rules.

			They are followed in their order. A whole rulebook full of rules may be
			assigned to an entity at once.

		.. py:property:: Engine.eternal

			A mapping of arbitrary data, not sensitive to sim-time.

			It's stored in the database. A good place to keep your game's settings.

		.. py:property:: Engine.universal

			A mapping of arbitrary data that changes over sim-time.

			The state of the randomizer is saved here under the key ``'rando_state'``.

		.. py:property:: Engine.trigger

			A mapping of, and decorator for, functions that might trigger a rule.

			Decorated functions get stored in the mapping as well as a file, so they can be
			loaded back in when the game is resumed.

		.. py:property:: Engine.prereq

			A mapping of, and decorator for, functions a rule might require to return True for it to run.

		.. py:property:: Engine.action

			A mapping of, and decorator for, functions that might manipulate the world state as a result of a rule running.

		.. py:property:: Engine.method

			A mapping of, and decorator for, extension methods to be added to the engine object.

		.. py:property:: Engine.function

			A mapping of, and decorator for, generic functions.

		.. py:property:: rule

			A mapping of :class:`LiSE.rule.Rule` objects, whether applied to an entity or not.

			Can also be used as a decorator on functions to make them into new rules, with the decorated function as
			their initial action.

		.. py:method:: Engine.next_turn

			Make time move forward in the simulation.

			Stops when the turn has ended, or a rule returns something non-``None``.

			This is also a :class:`blinker.Signal`, so you can register functions to be
			called when the simulation runs. Pass them to ``Engine.next_turn.connect(..)``.

			:return: a pair, of which item 0 is the returned value from a rule if applicable (default: ``[]``),
				and item 1 is a delta describing changes to the simulation resulting from this call.
				See the following method, :meth:`get_delta`, for a description of the delta format.

character
---------
.. automodule:: LiSE.character

	.. autoclass:: Character

		.. py:property:: stat

			A mapping of game-time-sensitive data.

		.. py:property:: place

			A mapping of :class:`LiSE.node.Place` objects in this :class:`Character`.

			Has a ``rule`` method for applying new rules to every :class:`Place` here, and a ``rulebook`` property for
			assigning premade rulebooks.

		.. py:property:: thing

			A mapping of :class:`LiSE.node.Thing` objects in this :class:`Character`.

			Has a ``rule`` method for applying new rules to every :class:`Thing` here, and a ``rulebook`` property for
			assigning premade rulebooks.

		.. py:property:: node

			A mapping of :class:`LiSE.node.Thing` and :class:`LiSE.node.Place` objects in this :class:`Character`.

			Has a ``rule`` method for applying new rules to every :class:`Node` here, and a ``rulebook`` property for
			assigning premade rulebooks.

		.. py:property:: portal

			A two-layer mapping of :class:`LiSE.portal.Portal` objects in this :class:`Character`, by origin and destination

			Has a ``rule`` method for applying new rules to every :class:`Portal` here, and a ``rulebook`` property for
			assigning premade rulebooks.

			Aliases:  ``adj``, ``edge``, ``succ``

		.. py:property:: preportal

			A two-layer mapping of :class:`LiSE.portal.Portal` objects in this :class:`Character`, by destination and origin

			Has a ``rule`` method for applying new rules to every :class:`Portal` here, and a ``rulebook`` property for
			assigning premade rulebooks.

			Alias: ``pred``

		.. py:property:: unit

			A mapping of this character's units in other characters.

			Units are nodes in other characters that are in some sense part of this one. A common example in strategy
			games is when a general leads an army: the general is one :class:`Character`, with a graph representing the
			state of their AI; the battle map is another :class:`Character`; and the general's units, though not in the
			general's :class:`Character`, are still under their command, and therefore follow rules defined on the
			general's ``unit.rule`` subproperty.
