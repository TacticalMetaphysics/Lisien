	:param prefix: directory containing the simulation and its code;
		defaults to the working directory. If ``None``, Lisien won't save
		any rules code to disk, and won't save world data unless you supply
		:param connect_string:.
	:param string: module storing strings to be used in the game; if absent,
		we'll use a :class:`lisien.xcollections.StringStore` to keep them in a
		JSON file in the ``prefix``.
	:param function: module containing utility functions; if absent, we'll
		use a :class:`lisien.xcollections.FunctionStore` to keep them in a .py
		file in the ``prefix``
	:param method: module containing functions taking this engine as
		first arg; if absent, we'll
		use a :class:`lisien.xcollections.FunctionStore` to keep them in a .py
		file in the ``prefix``.
	:param trigger: module containing trigger functions, taking a lisien
		entity and returning a boolean for whether to run a rule; if absent, we'll
		use a :class:`lisien.xcollections.FunctionStore` to keep them in a .py
		file in the ``prefix``.
	:param prereq: module containing prereq functions, taking a lisien entity and
		returning a boolean for whether to permit a rule to run; if absent, we'll
		use a :class:`lisien.xcollections.FunctionStore` to keep them in a .py
		file in the ``prefix``.
	:param action: module containing action functions, taking a lisien entity and
		mutating it (and possibly the rest of the world); if absent, we'll
		use a :class:`lisien.xcollections.FunctionStore` to keep them in a .py
		file in the ``prefix``.
	:param main_branch: the string name of the branch to start from. Defaults
		to "trunk" if not set in some prior session. You should only change
		this if your game generates new initial conditions for each
		playthrough.
	:param connect_string: a rfc1738 URI for a database to connect to. Leave
		``None`` to use the ParquetDB database in the ``prefix``.
	:param connect_args: Dictionary of keyword arguments for the
		database connection
	:param schema: A Schema class that determines which changes to allow to
		the world; used when a player should not be able to change just
		anything. Defaults to :class:`NullSchema`, which allows all changes.
	:param flush_interval: lisien will put pending changes into the database
		transaction every ``flush_interval`` turns. If ``None``, only flush
		on commit. Default ``None``.
	:param keyframe_interval: How many records to let through before automatically
		snapping a keyframe, default ``1000``. If ``None``, you'll need
		to call ``snap_keyframe`` yourself.
	:param commit_interval: Lisien will commit changes to disk every
		``commit_interval`` turns. If ``None`` (the default), only commit
		on close or manual call to ``commit``.
	:param random_seed: A number to initialize the randomizer.
	:param logfun: An optional function taking arguments
		``level, message``, which should log `message` somehow.
	:param clear: Whether to delete *any and all* existing data
		and code in ``prefix`` and the database. Use with caution!
	:param keep_rules_journal: Boolean; if ``True`` (the default), keep
		information on the behavior of the rules engine in the database.
		Makes the database rather large, but useful for debugging.
	:param keyframe_on_close: Whether to snap a keyframe when closing the
		engine, default ``True``. This is usually what you want, as it will
		make future startups faster, but could cause database bloat if
		your game runs few turns per session.
	:param enforce_end_of_time: Whether to raise an exception when
		time travelling to a point after the time that's been simulated.
		Default ``True``. You normally want this, but it could cause problems
		if you're not using the rules engine.
	:param workers: How many subprocesses to use as workers for
		parallel processing. When ``None`` (the default), use as many
		subprocesses as we have CPU cores. When ``0``, parallel processing
		is disabled. Note that ``workers=0`` implies that trigger
		functions operate on bare lisien objects, and can therefore have
		side effects. If you don't want this, instead use
		``workers=1``, which *does* disable parallelism in the case
		of trigger functions.

		Most keys will be character names, and their values will be

		'nodes' and 'edges' which contain booleans indicating whether
		the node or edge has been created (True) or deleted (False), and 'node_val' and
		'edge_val' for the stats of those entities. For edges (also
		called portals) these dictionaries are two layers deep, keyed
		first by the origin, then by the destination.

		Characters also have special keys for the various rulebooks
		they have:

		* ``'character_rulebook'``
		* ``'unit_rulebook'``
		* ``'character_thing_rulebook'``
		* ``'character_place_rulebook'``
		* ``'character_portal_rulebook'``

		And each node and edge may have a 'rulebook' stat of its own.
		If a node is a thing, it gets a 'location'; when the 'location'
		is deleted, that means it's back to being a place.

		Keys at the top level that are not character names:

		* ``'rulebooks'``, a dictionary keyed by the name of each changed
		  rulebook, the value being a list of rule names
		* ``'rules'``, a dictionary keyed by the name of each changed rule,
		  containing any of the lists ``'triggers'``, ``'prereqs'``,
		  and ``'actions'``

		Argument ``choices`` is a list of dictionaries, of which each must
		have values for ``"entity"`` (a lisien entity) and ``"changes"``
		-- the later being a list of lists of pairs. Each change list
		is applied on a successive turn, and each pair ``(key, value)``
		sets a key on the entity to a value on that turn.

		Returns a pair of lists containing acceptance and rejection messages,
		which the UI may present as it sees fit. They are always in a pair
		with the change request as the zeroth item. The message may be None
		or a string.

		Validator functions may return only a boolean indicating acceptance.
		If they instead return a pair, the initial boolean indicates
		acceptance and the following item is the message.

		This function will not actually result in any simulation happening.
		It creates a plan. See my ``plan`` context manager for the precise
		meaning of this.

		With ``dry_run=True`` just return the acceptances and rejections
		without really planning anything. With ``perfectionist=True`` apply
		changes if and only if all of them are accepted.
